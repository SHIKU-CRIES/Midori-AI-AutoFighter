# Repository Contributor Guide

This document summarizes common development practices for all services in this repository.

---


## Where to Look for Guidance (Per-Service Layout)
- **`.feedback/`**: Task lists and priorities. *Read only*—never edit directly. The old `feedback.md` file has been removed in favor of this directory.
- **`.codex/`** (inside each service directory, e.g., `WebUI/.codex/`, `Rest-Servers/.codex/`):
  - `instructions/`: Contributor mode docs, process notes, and service-specific instructions. Place all new and updated process documentation here, following the structure and naming conventions. See examples in this folder.
  - `implementation/`: Service-specific implementation notes and technical docs. Keep these in sync with code changes.
  - Other subfolders: `requests/`, `prototyping/`, etc. for planning, feedback, and prototyping notes.
- **Never edit files in `.codex/audit/` unless you are in Auditor mode.**
- **`.github/`**: Workflow guidelines and UX standards.

## Development Basics
- Use [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python environments and running code. Avoid `python` or `pip` directly.
- Use [`bun`](https://bun.sh/) for Node/React tooling instead of `npm` or `yarn`.
- Split large modules into smaller ones when practical and keep documentation in `*/.codex/implementation` in sync with code.
- If a build retry occurs, the workflow may produce a commit titled `"Applying previous commit."` when reapplying a patch.
  This is normal and does not replace the need for your own clear `[TYPE]` commit messages.
- Run available tests (e.g., `pytest`) before committing.
- Any test running longer than 15 seconds is automatically aborted in local development (using `run-tests.sh`). GitHub Actions CI has no timeout limits.
- **Linting is mandatory**: Run `ruff check . --fix` before every commit on Python code. All pull requests must pass linting checks in CI. See `.codex/implementation/linting-standards.md` for comprehensive guidelines.
- For Python style:
   - Place each import on its own line.
   - Sort imports within each group (standard library, third-party, project modules) from shortest to longest.
   - Insert a blank line between each import grouping (standard library, third-party, project modules).
   - Avoid inline imports.
   - For `from ... import ...` statements, group them after all `import ...` statements, and format each on its own line, sorted shortest to longest, with a blank line before the group. Example:

     ```python
     import os
     import time
     import logging
     import threading

     from datetime import datetime
     from rich.console import Console
     from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
     ```

## File Size and Readability (Repository-wide Rule)
- Aim for ~300 lines or fewer per file.
- Split monolithic modules into smaller units when they grow beyond this threshold.
- Keep code well commented and organized for readability.

## Contributor Modes
The repository supports several contributor modes to clarify expectations and best practices for different types of contributions:

> **MANDATORY: All contributors must read their mode's documentation in `.codex/modes/` before starting any work. Failure to do so may result in removal from the repository.**
> 
> Recent incidents (e.g., a coder updating audit files 3 times without following mode guidelines) have shown that skipping these docs leads to wasted effort and rework. This is not optional—review your mode doc every time you contribute.

**All contributors should regularly review and keep their mode cheat sheet in `.codex/notes/` up to date.**
Refer to your mode's cheat sheet for quick reminders and update it as needed.
For every task stub, prefix the request with the responsible role (e.g., ‘Task Master, …’, ‘Reviewer, …’, ‘Coder, …’).

- **Task Master Mode** (`.codex/modes/TASKMASTER.md`)
- **Coder Mode** (`.codex/modes/CODER.md`)
- **Reviewer Mode** (`.codex/modes/REVIEWER.md`)
- **Auditor Mode** (`.codex/modes/AUDITOR.md`)
- **Unknown Mode** (no file)

You must refer to the relevant mode guide in `.codex/modes/` before starting work, and follow the documentation structure and conventions described there. For service-specific details, see the `.codex/instructions/` folder of the service you are working on. Each service may provide additional rules in its own `AGENTS.md`—start here, then check the service directory for any extra requirements.

### Documentation sync
When adding or modifying player or foe plugins, update both `README.md` and `.codex/implementation/player-foe-reference.md` so the roster and enemy details stay accurate.
