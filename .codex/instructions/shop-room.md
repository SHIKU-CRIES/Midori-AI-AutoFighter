# Shop Room

Describes the shop room scene.

- Sells upgrade items and cards with gold prices and star ratings.
- Purchases deduct gold and add the item to the provided inventory; each item can be bought only once.
- ShopRoom records spawns per floor and `ShopRoom.should_spawn(floor)` enforces at least two shops on every floor.
- Inventory scales with floor level and can be rerolled for additional gold.
- Escape returns to the previous scene.
- The UI reuses the reward pop-up layout, shows current gold, and lists items with prices and buy buttons.
