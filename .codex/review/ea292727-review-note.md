# Review Note

## Scope
- .codex/planning/8a7d9c1e-panda3d-game-plan.md
- .codex/tasks/ac8cbde0-panda3d-task-order.md
- .codex/implementation/asset-pipeline.md
- .codex/implementation/game-workflow.md
- .codex/implementation/gacha-system.md
- .codex/audit/ac8cbde0-audit-report.audit.md

## Findings
- Asset conversion and loading are documented in `asset-pipeline.md`, but the task list still shows the asset manifest step unchecked.
- The main menu and Player Creator flows are detailed in `game-workflow.md`; however, the Player customization section in the task list leaves the implementation documentation checkbox empty.
- `gacha-system.md` outlines a presentation flow, yet the actual gacha presentation remains unimplemented and all corresponding task items are unchecked.

## Recommendations
- Update the Panda3D task order to mark completed documentation steps for the asset manifest and Player customization.
- Implement the gacha presentation and update both documentation and task status when complete.
