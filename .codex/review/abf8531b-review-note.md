# Review Note

## Scope
- README.md
- .codex/ (ideas, implementation, instructions, modes, tasks)
- .github/ (workflows and dependabot)
- Attempted game execution using `uv run main.py`

## Findings
- README.md describes basic gameplay and controls but lacks a step-by-step overview from launch to save, including how player data persists between runs.
- No documentation on running the game without audio/display; default run fails with `mixer not initialized` in headless environments.
- `.codex` and `.github` folders appear organized; no review or notes directories existed before this audit.
- Game execution logs show waves initializing and kills recorded, but the session required manual interruption and did not confirm automatic saving on player death.

## Recommendations
- Add documentation detailing the complete game loop, including save locations and end-of-run behavior.
- Document headless execution requirements and how to disable sound/mixer for test environments.
