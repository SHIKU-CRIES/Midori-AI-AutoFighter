Issue: MimicPlayerCopy passive never removes BUS subscription.

Details:
- `backend/plugins/passives/mimic_player_copy.py` subscribes to `effect_applied` during `apply`.
- No `unsubscribe` on battle end or cleanup, so the listener persists even after passive is removed.

Location: `backend/plugins/passives/mimic_player_copy.py` line 48.

Recommended fix: unsubscribe from `effect_applied` when the passive is cleared or at battle end.
