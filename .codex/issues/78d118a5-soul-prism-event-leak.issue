Issue: SoulPrism relic's BUS subscription persists without removal.

Details:
- `backend/plugins/relics/soul_prism.py` subscribes to `battle_end` to revive allies.
- Lacks an unsubscribe, so multiple applications can stack or persist beyond intended scope.

Location: `backend/plugins/relics/soul_prism.py` line 85.

Recommended fix: call `BUS.unsubscribe` during cleanup or after battle to prevent duplicate revival handlers.
