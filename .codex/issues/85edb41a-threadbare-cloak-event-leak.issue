Issue: `ThreadbareCloak` relic adds a `battle_end` listener but never unregisters it, causing repeated callbacks.

Details:
- `backend/plugins/relics/threadbare_cloak.py` subscribes `_reset` to `battle_end` without a matching `BUS.unsubscribe`.
- Each application of the relic appends another `_reset` handler, leading to multiple resets and memory growth.
- Persistent subscriptions may reference outdated party instances.

Location: `backend/plugins/relics/threadbare_cloak.py` lines 19-38.

Recommended fix: Unsubscribe the `_reset` handler after battle end or when the relic is removed.
