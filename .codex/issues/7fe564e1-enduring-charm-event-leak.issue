Issue: EnduringCharm card registers BUS listeners but never removes them.

Details:
- `backend/plugins/cards/enduring_charm.py` subscribes to `turn_start` and `damage_taken` in `apply`.
- No corresponding unsubscribe on battle end, so handlers persist across battles and may stack.

Location: `backend/plugins/cards/enduring_charm.py` lines 68-70.

Recommended fix: unsubscribe from BUS during cleanup (e.g., on battle_end) to prevent listener leaks.
