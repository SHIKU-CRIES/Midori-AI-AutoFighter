Issue: `KeenGoggles` card subscribes to BUS events without unregistering, leading to duplicate crit stack handlers.

Details:
- `backend/plugins/cards/keen_goggles.py` subscribes to `effect_applied` and `action_taken` but never removes these listeners.
- Multiple applications of the card would continually grow `crit_stacks` callbacks per player.
- Residual subscriptions could act on outdated party members, misapplying buffs.

Location: `backend/plugins/cards/keen_goggles.py` lines 18-73.

Recommended fix: Unsubscribe from BUS events on battle end or card removal to avoid stacking listeners.
