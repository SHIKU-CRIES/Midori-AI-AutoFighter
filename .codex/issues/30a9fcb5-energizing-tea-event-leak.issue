Issue: `EnergizingTea` card subscribes to `battle_start` without removing the listener, allowing duplicate triggers.

Details:
- `backend/plugins/cards/energizing_tea.py` registers `_on_battle_start` but never unsubscribes.
- If a party reloads or multiple battles occur, the handler stacks and grants excessive ultimate charge.
- Accumulated listeners can also slow BUS dispatch and retain party references.

Location: `backend/plugins/cards/energizing_tea.py` line 37.

Recommended fix: unsubscribe from `battle_start` after the bonus applies or when the card is removed.
