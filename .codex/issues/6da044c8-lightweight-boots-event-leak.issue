Issue: `LightweightBoots` card subscribes to the `dodge` event without cleanup, leaking handlers across battles.

Details:
- `backend/plugins/cards/lightweight_boots.py` registers `_on_dodge` but never unsubscribes.
- Reapplying the card re-adds the listener, causing duplicate heals and memory retention.
- Persistent BUS subscriptions may retain references to party members beyond battle end.

Location: `backend/plugins/cards/lightweight_boots.py` line 39.

Recommended fix: unsubscribe from `dodge` when battle ends or the card is removed.
