Issue: ThickSkin card subscribes to BUS events without cleanup.

Details:
- `backend/plugins/cards/thick_skin.py` adds an `effect_applied` listener in `apply`.
- There is no unsubscribe on battle end, so handlers linger between battles.

Location: `backend/plugins/cards/thick_skin.py` line 42.

Recommended fix: remove the listener when the card is deactivated or battle ends.
