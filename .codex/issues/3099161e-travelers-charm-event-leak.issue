Issue: `TravelersCharm` relic subscribes to multiple BUS events but never unregisters them, risking duplicate defensive buffs.

Details:
- `backend/plugins/relics/travelers_charm.py` subscribes to `damage_taken`, `turn_start`, and `turn_end` without cleanup.
- Reapplying the relic stacks additional handlers, triggering extra buffs or lingering references to past parties.
- Unbounded subscriptions may degrade performance across long sessions.

Location: `backend/plugins/relics/travelers_charm.py` lines 20-101.

Recommended fix: Unsubscribe these event handlers after battle end or when the relic is unequipped.
