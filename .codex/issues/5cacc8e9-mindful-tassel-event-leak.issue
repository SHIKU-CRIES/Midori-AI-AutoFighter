Issue: `MindfulTassel` card subscribes to BUS events without unregistering, accumulating listeners across battles.

Details:
- `backend/plugins/cards/mindful_tassel.py` registers `_on_effect_applied` and `_on_battle_start` handlers but never unsubscribes.
- Re-equipping or reapplying the card would stack duplicate callbacks on `effect_applied` and `battle_start`.
- Persistent listeners may reference prior parties or entities, causing unintended behavior.

Location: `backend/plugins/cards/mindful_tassel.py` lines 18-91.

Recommended fix: Unsubscribe from BUS events at battle end or when the card is removed to prevent handler duplication.
