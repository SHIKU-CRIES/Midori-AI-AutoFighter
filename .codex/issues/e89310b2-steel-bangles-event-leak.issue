Issue: SteelBangles card subscribes to BUS but lacks unsubscription.

Details:
- `backend/plugins/cards/steel_bangles.py` registers a `damage_dealt` listener in `apply`.
- No cleanup on battle end, causing callbacks to persist and stack if multiple battles occur.

Location: `backend/plugins/cards/steel_bangles.py` line 51.

Recommended fix: remove listener on battle_end or card removal to avoid memory/logic leaks.
