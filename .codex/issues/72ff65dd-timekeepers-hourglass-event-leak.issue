Issue: TimekeepersHourglass relic adds BUS listener without cleanup.

Details:
- `backend/plugins/relics/timekeepers_hourglass.py` subscribes to `turn_start` in `apply`.
- No corresponding unsubscribe, so extra-turn logic may trigger even after relic removal or across battles.

Location: `backend/plugins/relics/timekeepers_hourglass.py` line 33.

Recommended fix: unsubscribe on battle end or when the relic is unequipped to avoid stale callbacks.
