Coder, add a main menu panel that displays daily login rewards using left-to-right chevrons.

## Requirements
- Place the panel in the centered banner space described in `.codex/instructions/main-menu.md`.
- Show a row of chevrons representing each day in the current streak.
- Highlight today's chevron and list the reward items beneath it.
- Display a countdown timer to the 2am PT reset.
- Clear the UI and restart at day 1 if the player misses a day.
- Fetch streak data and rewards from the new backend endpoints.
- Ensure the panel adapts to desktop/tablet/phone breakpoints.

## Notes
- Follow existing main menu styling conventions and Lucide icon usage.
- Include tooltip or hover text summarizing reward contents.
