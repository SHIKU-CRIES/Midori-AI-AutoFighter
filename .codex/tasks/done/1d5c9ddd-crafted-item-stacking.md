# Stack crafted items and clean names (`1d5c9ddd`)

## Summary
Crafted items appear as separate entries and use inconsistent naming, cluttering the crafting menu.

## Tasks
- [x] Group crafted items by type and star-rank so identical items stack into one entry.
- [x] Show quantity counts on stacked entries and ensure counts update when crafting or consuming items.
- [x] Normalize item name formatting (consistent capitalization and spacing).
- [x] Add frontend tests covering stacking behavior and name display.
- [x] Document stacking rules and naming conventions in the crafting docs.

## Context
Feedback notes that "crafted items do not stack and names are janky," making the inventory hard to scan.
