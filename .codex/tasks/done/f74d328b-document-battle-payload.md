# Document Battle Endpoint Payload

## Summary
The frontend needs clarity on the JSON format expected by the `/rooms/<run_id>/battle` endpoint so room clicks can send valid data.

## Instructions
- Inspect the backend `battle_room` implementation and tests to determine required and optional fields.
- Document the payload structure and example in `.codex/implementation/`.
- Update frontend implementation notes if changes are needed.

## Context
Defines the contract between frontend room selection and backend combat resolution.
