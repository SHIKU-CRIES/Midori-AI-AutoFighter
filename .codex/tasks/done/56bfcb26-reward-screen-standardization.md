# Standardize reward screen and asset loading (`56bfcb26`)

## Summary
Reward UI is unthemed, lacks card descriptions, and offers no relic reward screen. Assets fail to load when rewards appear.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create a unified reward screen component that handles cards and relics.
- [ ] Load and display icons and description text for each card reward.
- [ ] Implement a relic reward screen using the same component and asset pipeline.
- [ ] Prevent room progression until the player acknowledges rewards.
- [ ] Add frontend tests confirming assets and descriptions render for both reward types.

## Context
Feedback describes missing card descriptions, absent relic rewards, and unthemed menus that appear outside the battle viewport.
