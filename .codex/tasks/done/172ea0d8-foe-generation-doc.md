# Document foe naming and stat modifiers

## Summary
Describe how enemy names are generated and how those names influence their stats.

## Details
- Explain that names are formed by pairing adjectives and themed names from `themedstuff.py`.
- Detail how each adjective and name component contributes bonuses in `foe_passive_builder.py`.
- Include special handling for foes whose names begin with "Lady" and the additional modifiers applied.
- Provide at least one illustrative example (e.g., "Atrocious Luna") to demonstrate the process.

## Notes
- Based on `.codex/tasks/fc943934-player-foe-docs.md`.
