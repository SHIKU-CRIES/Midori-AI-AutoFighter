# Implement inventory screen (`28b25db1`)

## Summary
There is no way to view collected loot, making reward verification and testing difficult.

## Tasks
- [x] Replace the existing stats screen with an inventory screen accessible during runs.
- [x] Display cards, relics, and other items with icons, counts, and descriptions.
- [x] Allow opening the inventory after battles to review newly acquired loot.
- [x] Persist inventory state across rooms within a run.
- [x] Write frontend tests ensuring items appear in inventory after rewards.

## Context
Battle feedback highlights the absence of an inventory view, blocking confirmation of rewards and EXP gains.
