# Implement Room Endpoints with Game Logic
Replace stub responses with real battle, shop, and rest logic and provide an endpoint for room images.

## Requirements
- Update `backend/app.py` to call existing game logic for room interactions.
- Add an endpoint that serves room images.
- Revise `.codex/implementation/room-endpoints.md` to describe the real behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria
- API responses reflect actual game state.
- Room image endpoint returns correct assets.
- Tests verify each endpoint.
