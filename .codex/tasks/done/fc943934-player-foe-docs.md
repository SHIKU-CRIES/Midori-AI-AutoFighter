# Document players and foes

## Summary
Create reference documentation that explains the playable character roster and how enemies are generated and modified.

## Details
- List each player plugin with a short description and any unique traits.
- Describe how foe names combine adjectives and themed names and the stat bonuses applied in `foe_passive_builder.py`.
- Keep README and plugin documentation in sync as new characters or modifiers are added.

## Notes
- Use `plugins/players/` and `foe_passive_builder.py` as primary sources.
