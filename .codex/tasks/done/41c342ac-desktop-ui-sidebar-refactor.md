# Refactor desktop layout with right sidebar

## Summary
Implement three-window desktop layout with party viewer and target stats panel on the left and a fixed game viewport on the right.

## Tasks
- Add small party viewer window left of the game viewport.
- Create target stats panel that slides over the party viewer on selection.

## Context
Current frontend only shows combat view; required side windows and sidebar are missing.

## Notes
Ensure layout scales cleanly and follows Game Viewpoint standard.

## Outcome
Desktop mode now positions a compact party viewer and sliding target stats panel to the left of a fixed game viewport, restoring the stained-glass sidebar for menu actions.
