# Rebuild settings panel with framerate and autocraft

## Summary
Redesign the settings panel to use three columns and provide framerate and autocraft controls.

## Tasks
- Split settings into audio, system/gameplay, and other columns.
- Add framerate selector with 30/60/120 FPS options that govern server polling.
- Expose autocraft toggle within the settings panel.

## Context
Existing settings menu lacks required columns and features, diverging from the Game Viewpoint standard.

## Notes
Ensure panel overlays without affecting viewport size.

## Outcome
Settings menu now organizes controls into audio, system/gameplay, and other columns, adds a 30/60/120 FPS selector, and exposes an autocraft toggle.
