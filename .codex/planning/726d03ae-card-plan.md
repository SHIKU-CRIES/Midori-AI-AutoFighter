# Card Design

Parent: [Web Game Plan](8a7d9c1e-web-game-plan.md)

## Guiding Principles
- Cards are unique rewards with a single copy each.
- Strength scales by star rank: 1★ offers tiny bonuses, while 5★ radically changes how battles play out.
- *Aftertaste* is a damage FX with a base pot of 25 and a random 0.1–1.5 modifier; several relics / cards reference this effect.
- *Critical Boost* grants +0.5% Crit Rate and +5% Crit Damage per stack but vanishes when the unit is hit.
