# Card Inventory

`CardInventory.svelte` lists collected cards inside a shared `MenuPanel`. The
menu shows each card's name in a wrapped grid and displays a placeholder message
when no cards are owned. The inventory can be accessed during combat to review
collected cards and their effects. The broader `InventoryPanel.svelte` now also
shows upgrade materials in a Star‑Rail‑style grid with quantity badges and a
detail pane.
