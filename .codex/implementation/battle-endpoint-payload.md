# Battle Endpoint Payload

`POST /rooms/<run_id>/battle` resolves the next battle node. Fights are fully automated, looping until one side falls, and the backend echoes any provided `action` string. Each round triggers passives and processes damage or healing over time effects before exchanging attacks, pausing briefly between turns to keep the loop async-friendly.

## Request
- `action` (string, optional)

## Response
- `result` (string): always `"battle"` for this endpoint.
- `run_id` (string): identifier for the active run.
- `action` (string): echoes the request `action` or defaults to an empty string.
- `party` (array): updated stats for each party member.
- `gold` (integer): current shared gold pool.
- `relics` (array): list of acquired relic IDs.
- `cards` (array): list of owned card IDs.
- `card_choices` (array): up to three card options with `id`, `name`, and `stars`.
- `relic_choices` (array): up to three relic options with `id`, `name`, and `stars`.
- `loot` (object): summary of rewards with `gold`, `card_choices`, `relic_choices`, and `items` arrays.
- `foes` (array): stats for spawned foes.

Generic damage types are reserved for the Luna player character; other combatants use elemental types such as Fire, Ice, Lightning, Light, Dark, or Wind.
