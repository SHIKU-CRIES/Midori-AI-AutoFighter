# GUI Reset

The legacy `game/ui` package was removed to restart the interface from a clean slate. All future GUI work must follow the web UI component guidelines (see [Svelte documentation](https://svelte.dev/docs)).

Developers should review the Svelte docs before touching any GUI code. Do not commit downloaded documentation to the repository.
