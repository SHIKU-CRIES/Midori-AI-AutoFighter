# Asset Loader

`assetLoader.js` centralizes character portraits, backgrounds, and damage type assets for the frontend.

- Character portraits are loaded from `frontend/src/lib/assets/characters` and resolved to absolute URLs via Vite's `import.meta.glob(..., { as: 'url', eager: true })`. When `import.meta.glob` isn't available (e.g., during tests), the loader returns an empty map and relies on fallback logic. Missing portraits fall back to the repository logo.
- Backgrounds rotate hourly using a seeded random selector and fall back to the repository logo when none are available.
- `getElementIcon` and `getElementColor` expose consistent damage type icons and colors for Fire, Ice, Lightning, Light, Dark, Wind, and Generic types.

The loader is shared by the party picker, map display, and battle view so character images and type colors stay in sync across the UI. URL handling is normalized so root-relative or absolute URLs are not re-resolved, preventing malformed `file://` URLs in non-browser contexts.

## Testing
- `bun test frontend/tests/assetloader.test.js`
