# Event Bus Wrapper

A lightweight publish/subscribe system so plugins can communicate without
engine‑specific dependencies. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous
callbacks and provides performance instrumentation.

## Usage
- `subscribe(event: str, callback: Callable)` – register a callback for an
  event. Callback may be sync or async.
- `unsubscribe(event: str, callback: Callable)` – remove a previously
  registered callback.
- `emit(event: str, *args)` – broadcast an event. When an event loop is
  running and async dispatch is preferred, emissions are batched for better
  throughput; otherwise callbacks run synchronously.
- `emit_async(event: str, *args)` – await completion of all callbacks. This
  calls the internal `send_async` implementation which awaits coroutine
  callbacks directly and offloads sync ones to a thread pool.

Battle-scoped plugins like cards and relics should unsubscribe their handlers
(e.g., on `battle_end`) to avoid lingering listeners across encounters.

Subscriber errors are caught and logged so one misbehaving plugin does not crash
others.

## Asynchronous dispatch
`EventBus.subscribe` detects coroutine functions and registers an async‑aware
wrapper. When events are emitted:

- `send_async` awaits coroutine callbacks directly and uses
  `loop.run_in_executor` only for synchronous functions. This avoids the
  thread‑pool hop for async subscribers.
- The synchronous `send` path schedules coroutine subscribers with
  `create_task` if a loop is running. If no loop is present, the bus logs a
  warning and the coroutine is not executed.

When writing coroutine callbacks, avoid long blocking operations. Offload any
CPU‑bound or blocking work to your own executor to keep the event loop
responsive.

## Batching and adaptive intervals
High‑frequency events (e.g. `damage_dealt`, `damage_taken`, `hit_landed`,
`heal_received`) are batched. Events collected within a frame (default
`16 ms`) are processed together to reduce overhead. The batch interval can be
adaptive—when load is low, batches are processed more quickly; during heavy
load, the interval grows to maintain responsiveness.

Each callback and batch item yields `await asyncio.sleep(0.002)` to give other
tasks a chance to run.

## Events
The core combat engine emits a few global events that plugins may subscribe to:

- `damage_dealt(attacker, target, amount)`
- `damage_taken(target, attacker, amount)`
- `heal(healer, target, amount)`
- `heal_received(target, healer, amount)`
- `hit_landed(attacker, target, amount, source_type="attack", source_name=None)` – emitted when a successful hit occurs

Plugins can define additional event names as needed.
