# Menu Overlay and Resizing

Menus render inside the game viewport beneath the stained‑glass top bar.
All full-screen menus (e.g., `PartyPicker`, `SettingsMenu`) sit inside the
`OverlaySurface` component and wrap their contents with the shared
`MenuPanel` to enforce padding, border, and 99% sizing. The surface fills the
remaining space and clips its own overflow so individual menus focus on
internal layout. To prevent stray scrollbars, a menu’s root container should
size itself just under the surface dimensions (around 99% of width and
height) and use flexible units so panels and portraits shrink with the
viewport. Avoid fixed widths or implicit minimums by applying `min-width: 0`
to grid and flex items that need to collapse. Grids that display cards should
define tracks in percentages (e.g., `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(0, 25%))` for
four columns) so elements stay proportional to the menu.
