# Arknights-Inspired UI Implementation

## Overview
The main menu has been refactored to implement the Arknights-inspired design specified in the planning document. The new UI features a high-contrast, touch-friendly layout with frosted-glass panels and modern visual elements.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Main Menu Layout
- **2x3 High-Contrast Grid**: Six main action buttons arranged in a 2x3 grid
- **Bottom Anchoring**: Button grid positioned near the bottom edge for easy touch access
- **Generous Spacing**: 0.2 units vertical spacing for comfortable touch targets
- **Rounded Pills**: Buttons use rounded pill shapes with dark frosted-glass styling

### 2. Top Bar Design
- **Frosted-Glass Effect**: Semi-transparent dark panel (0.1, 0.1, 0.15, 0.8)
- **Player Avatar**: Positioned on the left with rounded frame effect
- **Player Name**: Modern sans-serif typography in white
- **Currencies**: Gold and tickets display with blue accent tinting
- **Corner Icons**: Quick-access buttons for messages and folders

### 3. Central Banner
- **Event Showcase**: Central panel for announcements and events
- **Welcome Message**: "Welcome to Midori AI AutoFighter" with large typography
- **Themed Background**: Uses menu background texture with overlay

### 4. Enhanced Navigation
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected buttons scale up (2.1x) and change color
- **Highlight System**: Bright accent color (0.25, 0.25, 0.35) for selected state
- **Keyboard Support**: Arrow keys and Enter for full navigation
- **Consistent Styling**: All buttons use the same frosted-glass theme

## Technical Implementation

### Scaling System
- Menus rely on responsive CSS; elements scale with the viewport rather
  than a fixed 16:9 ratio.
- Button scale: 2.0x base (2.1x when highlighted)
- Icon scale: 1.2x base
- Top bar and banner use proper frameSize for precise positioning

### Color Palette
- **Background**: Dark navy (0.15, 0.15, 0.2) for high contrast
- **Highlighted**: Accent blue (0.25, 0.25, 0.35) for selection
- **Text**: Pure white (1, 1, 1, 1) for maximum readability
- **Currencies**: Light blue tint (0.9, 0.9, 1, 1) for accent

### Modular Architecture
The setup method is broken into focused helper methods:
- `setup_background()`: Dark cloud-like background
- `setup_top_bar()`: Frosted-glass header with avatar/currencies
- `setup_banner()`: Central event showcase panel
- `setup_button_grid()`: Main 2x3 action grid
- `setup_navigation()`: Keyboard/controller input handling

## Future Enhancements
- Animated background drift for cloud effects
- Hover animations for button scaling
- Theme switching for different visual styles
- Dynamic banner content based on game events
- Improved touch gesture support

## Testing Considerations
- Headless test compatibility maintained through exception handling
- Type stubs preserved for development environment flexibility
- Navigation flow tested with keyboard and mouse input
- Visual scaling verified across different window sizes
