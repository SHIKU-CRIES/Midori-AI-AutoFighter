# Player and Foe Reference

Player and Foe base classes assign a random damage type when one is not
provided, and battle rooms respect these preset elements without selecting new
types.

Each instance initializes its own LangChain ChromaDB memory tied to the current
run. Use `send_lrm_message` to interact with the LRM and `receive_lrm_message`
to log replies. Conversations remain isolated between combatants and reset for
new runs.

## Player Roster
All legacy characters from the Pygame version have been ported as plugins.
Each entry notes the character's `CharacterType` and starting damage type.
Players currently share placeholder stats of 1000 HP, 100 attack, 50 defense,
5% crit rate, 2× crit damage, 1% effect hit, 100 mitigation, 0 dodge, and 1
for remaining values.

Player plugins also include a `gacha_rarity` field so the gacha system can
automatically discover 5★ and 6★ recruits.
Each player and foe defines `prompt` and `about` strings with placeholder text
to support future character-specific prompts.

- **Ally** (B, random) – applies `ally_passive` on load to grant ally-specific bonuses.
- **Becca** (B, random) – builds high attack but takes more damage from lower defense.
- **Bubbles** (A, random) – starts with a default item and applies `bubbles_passive`.
- **Carly** (B, Light) – applies `carly_passive`.
- **Chibi** (A, random) – gains four times the normal benefit from Vitality.
- **Graygray** (B, random) – applies `graygray_passive`.
- **Hilander** (A, random) – builds increased crit rate and crit damage.
- **Kboshi** (A, random) – randomly changes damage type.
- **Lady Darkness** (B, Dark) – baseline fighter themed around darkness.
- **Lady Echo** (B, Lightning) – baseline fighter themed around echoes.
- **Lady Fire and Ice** (B, Fire or Ice) – baseline fighter themed around fire and ice.
- **Lady Light** (B, Light) – baseline fighter themed around light.
- **Lady of Fire** (B, Fire) – baseline fighter themed around fire.
- **Luna** (B, Generic) – applies `luna_passive`.
- **Mezzy** (B, random) – only raises Max HP and takes less damage.
- **Mimic** (C, random) – copies the player then lowers its stats by 25% on spawn.
- **Player** (C, chosen) – avatar representing the user and may select any non-Generic damage type.

Characters marked as "random" roll one of the six elements when first loaded
and reuse that element in future sessions.

## Foe Generation
Foe plugins inherit from `FoeBase`, which mirrors `PlayerBase` stats but begins
with minimal mitigation and vitality (0.001 each) that grow by 0.0001 on
level-up. To keep encounters from stalling, foes regain health at one hundredth
the player rate.
They are procedurally named by prefixing a randomly selected adjective plugin
from `plugins/themedadj` to a player name. Adjective plugins are
auto-discovered based on files in that directory, so adding a new adjective
requires only dropping a file into the folder. Each adjective class applies its own
stat changes derived from the legacy project—for example, **Atrocious** boosts
max HP by 90% and attack by 10%. These adjustments are applied as persistent
`StatModifier` buffs so base stats return to normal once the foe is defeated.

Example: **Atrocious Luna** applies the adjective's stat bonuses to the base
player stats and prefixes the foe's name, yielding a combatant whose title
reflects its enhanced abilities.

Development builds include a `Slime` foe plugin that reduces all baseline stats
by 90% for simple battle testing. Standard battles may also spawn random player
characters that are not currently in the party. These player foes are wrapped in
`FoeBase` at load time, granting them foe-specific behaviors such as periodic
HP regeneration via `maybe_regain`.
