# Panda3D Tasks and Plan Audit

## Scope
- Reviewed `.codex/planning/8a7d9c1e-panda3d-game-plan.md`.
- Audited Panda3D task order and all tasks under `.codex/tasks/d801ffaa-panda3d-remake`.
- Inspected `.github` workflows and documentation files.

## Findings
- Task files lacked detail and did not fully reflect the planning document.
- Planning document is comprehensive and required no edits.

## Actions
- Expanded task order and individual Panda3D tasks with verbose, actionable steps aligned to the plan.

## Next Steps
- Implement tasks in the documented order and keep tasks synchronized with future planning updates.
