# Audit Report

## Summary
- Reviewed repository documentation and configuration to ensure alignment with current game behavior.
- Confirmed Warrior player fully removed across codebase, tests, and docs.
- Verified README and `.codex/implementation` docs cover headless execution, game workflow, player roster, and foe generation.
- Checked `.github` workflows to ensure SDL dummy drivers are set for tests.
- Inspected `.codex/instructions` for guidance on audio mocking, headless CI, and documentation sync.
- Searched codebase for remaining Warrior references and missing newlines.

## Findings
- No discrepancies found between documentation and implementation.
- All referenced files contain expected information, and no residual Warrior references remain.
