# Midori AI AutoFighter Development Instructions

**ALWAYS follow these instructions first**. Only search for additional information or run exploration commands if the information here is incomplete or contradicted by actual behavior.

<!-- MCP TOOLS REMINDER -->
> NOTE FOR CODING AGENTS: Use MCP-style helper tools for task planning and research. Always prefer the `sequentialthinking` (sequential thought planning) tool for multi-step reasoning and the Context7 tools (e.g., `mcp_context7_resolve-library-id` / `mcp_context7_get-library-docs`) when you need up-to-date library documentation or API references. These tools improve traceability and should be used for all non-trivial tasks.


## Repository Overview

Midori AI AutoFighter is a web-based auto-battler game with a Svelte frontend and Python Quart backend. The repository includes automated builds for Windows, Linux, and Android platforms with optional LLM (Language Model) support.

### Directory Structure
- `backend/` - Python Quart backend with game logic and AI features
- `frontend/` - Svelte frontend with responsive design  
- `legacy/` - Previous Pygame version (read-only, do not modify)
- `build/` - Build scripts and configuration
- `.codex/` - Documentation and contributor guides

## Required Tools Installation

Tools are now autoinstalled into your dev env.

**CRITICAL**: Always use `uv` for Python and `bun` for Node.js. Never use `pip` or `npm` directly as they are slower and not compatible with the repository's tooling.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Bootstrap and Test the Repository

**MANDATORY**: Always run the full test suite first to understand the current state:

```bash
# Run all tests - takes ~2 minutes. NEVER CANCEL.
./run-tests.sh
```

**Timeout Warning**: Set timeout to 180+ seconds. Some backend tests may take up to 15 seconds each, and the full suite runs ~60+ tests.

**Expected Result**: Most tests should pass. Some tests may fail (this is normal for active development). One test (`backend tests/test_app.py`) typically times out at 15 seconds - this is expected.

### 2. Building the Application

#### Quick Build (Non-LLM)
```bash
# Build non-llm variant - takes ~1 minute. NEVER CANCEL.
./build.sh non-llm

# Build for specific platform
./build.sh non-llm linux
./build.sh non-llm windows
```

**Timeout Warning**: Set timeout to 120+ seconds for non-LLM builds.

#### LLM Builds (WARNING: VERY SLOW)
```bash
# LLM builds - takes 10+ minutes. NEVER CANCEL.
./build.sh llm-cpu    # CPU-only LLM support
./build.sh llm-cuda   # NVIDIA GPU support  
./build.sh llm-amd    # AMD GPU support
```

**CRITICAL TIMEOUT WARNING**: LLM builds take 10-15 minutes or longer due to PyTorch and transformer dependencies. Set timeout to 1200+ seconds (20+ minutes). DO NOT cancel these builds.

#### Android Builds (EXPERIMENTAL)
```bash
# Android non-llm build only
./build.sh non-llm android
```

**Status**: Android builds are experimental and may fail due to SDL/pygame compatibility issues. Only non-LLM variant is supported.

**Expected Output**: 
- Non-LLM build: ~549MB executable in `backend/dist/midori-autofighter-non-llm-linux`
- LLM builds: Much larger executables (1GB+) due to PyTorch dependencies
- Build artifacts also created in `backend/build/` directory

### 3. Running the Application

#### Backend Only
```bash
cd backend
uv run app.py
```

**Expected**: Server starts on `http://localhost:59002`. You should see "Torch and LLM dependencies are not available" unless LLM extras are installed.

#### Frontend Development
```bash
cd frontend
bun run dev
```

**Expected**: Development server starts on `http://localhost:59001`

#### Frontend Build
```bash
cd frontend
bun run build
```

**Timeout**: Takes ~18 seconds. Set timeout to 60+ seconds.

#### Docker Compose (LIMITATION)
```bash
# KNOWN ISSUE: Currently fails due to network connectivity problems
docker compose up --build frontend backend
```

**Status**: Docker builds currently fail due to DNS resolution issues in the build environment. Use direct backend/frontend execution instead.

## Linting and Code Quality

### Backend Linting (MANDATORY)
```bash
# ALWAYS run before committing
uv tool run ruff check backend --fix

# Check entire repository  
uv tool run ruff check . --fix
```

**Expected Result**: Should show "All checks passed!" when no issues remain, or "Found X errors (X fixed, 0 remaining)" when fixes are applied.

### Frontend Linting
```bash
cd frontend
bun run lint        # Check for issues
bun run lint:fix    # Auto-fix issues
```

**Known Issues**: Some linting errors currently exist in the frontend. These do not block development but should be addressed.

## Testing

### Running Individual Tests
```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
uv run pytest tests/test_specific_file.py

# Frontend tests  
cd frontend
bun test tests/specific.test.js
```

### Test Timeouts
- **Local Development**: Tests auto-cancel after 15 seconds
- **CI Environment**: No timeout limits
- **Full Test Suite**: Takes ~2 minutes total

## Validation Scenarios

After making changes, ALWAYS test these scenarios:

### 1. Basic Backend API Test
```bash
# Start backend
cd backend && uv run app.py

# In another terminal, test API
curl http://localhost:59002/
# Expected: {"flavor":"default","status":"ok"}
```

### 2. Build Validation
```bash
# Test non-LLM build works
./build.sh non-llm
ls -la backend/dist/midori-autofighter-non-llm-linux
# Expected: ~549MB executable file
```

### 3. Frontend Build Validation
```bash
cd frontend
bun run build
ls -la build/
# Expected: Generated static files including _app/ directory and effekseer.wasm (~1.1MB)
```

## Build Variants and Platforms

### Available Variants
- **non-llm**: Base game without AI features (~549MB)
- **llm-cpu**: CPU-based language models (1GB+)
- **llm-cuda**: NVIDIA GPU acceleration (1GB+)  
- **llm-amd**: AMD GPU acceleration (1GB+)

### Supported Platforms
- **Linux**: All variants supported
- **Windows**: All variants supported
- **Android**: Only non-llm variant supported

## Known Issues and Limitations

### 1. Executable Plugin Discovery
Built executables may fail with plugin discovery errors. This is a known issue in the build process.

### 2. Docker Compose Networking
Docker builds currently fail due to DNS resolution problems. Use direct execution instead.

### 3. LLM Dependencies
LLM variants require significant additional dependencies and build time. Only use when specifically needed for AI features.

### 4. Test Failures
Some tests may fail in active development. Only fix test failures related to your specific changes.

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions
- **Build workflows**: Automatically build all variants on push/PR
- **Test workflows**: Run complete test suite with matrix strategy
- **Linting**: Separate jobs for backend (`uvx ruff check`) and frontend (`bunx eslint`)

### Required Checks
Before pushing changes:
```bash
# 1. Run linting
uv tool run ruff check backend --fix
cd frontend && bun run lint:fix

# 2. Run tests
./run-tests.sh

# 3. Test builds (optional for minor changes)
./build.sh non-llm
```

3. If unrelated, document and proceed

### Development Environment Issues
2. Clear caches: `uv cache clean`
3. Restart development servers
