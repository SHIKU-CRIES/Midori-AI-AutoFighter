# TripleRingSpinner Component

Renders three concentric rings with element-colored dots. Each dot orbits its ring using the `spin` animation while the rings
pulse with `pulse`. Animation timing is configurable via the `duration` prop and defaults to theme variables. The component
also accepts a `color` prop for customizing the ring and dot color and respects the `reducedMotion` flag to disable animations
when necessary.
