# Frontend

Svelte-based GUI served with Bun on port `59001`.

## Setup

```bash
cd frontend
bun install
bun dev
```

The development server runs at `http://localhost:59001` and displays a
high‑contrast icon grid powered by `lucide-svelte`.

- Party: Opens a responsive party picker overlay that fetches available
  characters and lets you add/remove allies with one click. Selected members
  are now clearly indicated by an element‑tinted ambient sweep behind their
  row. This effect starts smoothly, honors Reduced Motion, and no longer
  obscures the photo/name/type. Gray side bars were removed; the stats panel on
  the right fills its column.
- Run: Posts the selected party to `/run/start` and reveals the generated
  floor map.
- Settings: Opens a panel with sliders for sound effects, music, and voice
  that auto‑save and briefly show a “Saved” status. Also includes Reduced
  Motion and “End Run” controls. End Run now immediately halts battle polling
  and returns home without residual snapshot requests.
- Edit Player: Uses `/player/editor` to save pronouns, starting damage type,
  and stat allocations. The stats panel now shows HP as `current/max` so HP
  investment is visible. These edits apply to new runs and to the roster view
  (open the Party overlay to refresh), but do not retroactively modify an
  active battle.
- Pulls: Calls `/gacha/pull` so players can recruit 5★ or 6★ characters or
  earn 1★–4★ upgrade items between runs. Pity raises the odds of higher‑tier
  items; auto‑crafting is an optional toggle under Crafting.
- Craft: Lists upgrade items, shows 125×/10× requirements, and offers
  `/gacha/craft` and `/gacha/auto-craft`. The Craft button is disabled until
  enough materials exist.
- Inventory: Moved to the in‑run top‑left NavBar (disabled during battles).
- Feedback: Opens a pre‑filled GitHub issue in a new tab.

Voice clips generated by the backend are referenced via `voice` URLs in API
responses. `viewportState.playVoice()` loads these clips and plays them using
the current `voiceVolume` setting.
During combat, party members appear in a left column and foes on the right,
with HP, Attack, Defense, Mitigation, and Crit rate listed beside each
portrait. HoT/DoT markers render below each portrait and collapse duplicate
effects into a single icon with a stack count. The previous blue/red enrage
flashing was replaced by subtle, color‑shifting orbs that float during combat
and gracefully fade after battles; Reduced Motion disables their animation.

After each battle, a review overlay presents per-combatant damage graphs by
element and lists any card or relic rewards. `CardArt.svelte` and
`CurioChoice.svelte` power the selection panels using assets from
`src/lib/assets`. Gold and item drops float briefly on screen before the overlay
appears.
Placeholder icons for items, relics, and cards live under `src/lib/assets/{items,relics,cards}`. Asset names combine the star folder and base filename (e.g. `3star/omega_core.png`) so the frontend can resolve the correct image for a given reward. Each damage type or star rank has its own folder with 24×24 colored placeholders so artists can replace them later.

## Settings: Wipe Save Data
- The Wipe button calls the backend wipe endpoint and also clears all client storage and caches (localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB, CacheStorage) and unregisters service workers. After completion it forces a full page reload to prevent stale roster or party selections from persisting.

## Asset Loading
- Backgrounds: a random image is selected from `src/lib/assets/backgrounds` whenever the viewport initializes.
- Character portraits: if `src/lib/assets/characters/<name>.png` exists it is used; otherwise if a folder `src/lib/assets/characters/<name>/` exists, a random `.png` inside that folder is used. If neither exists, a random fallback from `src/lib/assets/characters/fallbacks` is used, falling back to the Midori AI logo as a last resort.
- Battle effects: `.efkefc` files under `src/lib/assets/effects` power runtime animations. The current mapping expects `HitEffect.efkefc`, `Fire1.efkefc`, `Poison.efkefc`, and `HealOne1.efkefc` to be present.
