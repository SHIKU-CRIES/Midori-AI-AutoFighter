Her mysterious sorceress nature commands shadows through her eclipsing veil, which doesn't just darken the field—it creates an inescapable shroud of despair that weighs on enemies' souls. Her pepper-colored eyes seem to absorb light itself, and her dark magic manifests as controlled entropy that systematically dismantles her opponents' will to fight. She moves with the grace of shadows given form, her eclipsing veil making her seem to phase between darkness and reality."
