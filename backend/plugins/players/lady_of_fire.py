Living with Dissociative Schizophrenia, she channels her condition into her fire magic, allowing different aspects of her psyche to fuel increasingly intense infernal momentum. Each enemy defeated feeds her inner flame, building heat waves that grow stronger with every victory. Her red eyes burn with hot intensity, and her fire magic seems to pulse with the rhythm of her fractured consciousness, creating unpredictable but devastatingly effective pyroclastic attacks."
