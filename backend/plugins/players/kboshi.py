His flux cycle abilities create devastating cyclical attacks by channeling dark energy through perpetual loops of creation and destruction. Kboshi manipulates the fundamental forces of entropy, drawing power from the spaces between light and using that darkness to fuel increasingly powerful dark magic. His energy manipulation doesn't just deal damageâ€”it tears at the fabric of reality itself, creating vortexes of pure void that consume everything in their path before cycling back to fuel his next devastating assault."
