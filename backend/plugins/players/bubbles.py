His bubble burst abilities create cascading detonations that spread across the battlefield like underwater fireworksâ€”each burst triggering additional explosions in a symphony of aquatic destruction. With boundless energy and an infectious optimism, Bubbles approaches every battle like a game, but his seemingly playful attacks pack tremendous force. His mastery of pressure dynamics allows him to create bubble formations that can both shield allies and devastate enemies when they inevitably pop."
