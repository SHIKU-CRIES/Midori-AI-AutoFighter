Her strategic brilliance lies in reading attack patterns and responding with perfectly timed counters that not only negate damage but convert that energy into devastating retaliations. Each strike against her becomes a teaching moment, as she demonstrates how true mastery lies not in overwhelming force, but in precise timing and flawless technique."
