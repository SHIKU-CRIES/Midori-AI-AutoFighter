# Gacha endpoints

Exposes gacha pulls and state through Quart.

## Routes
- `GET /gacha` returns the current pity counter, element-based upgrade item
-  totals, owned characters with duplicate stacks, and whether auto-crafting is
-  enabled.
- `POST /gacha/pull` accepts a JSON body with `count` (1, 5, or 10) and returns
  pull results plus the updated state. Each pull consumes one ticket; the server
  responds with **403** when tickets are insufficient. Results include `rarity`
  for character (5★ or 6★) and item pulls (1★–4★) keyed by element. Higher pity
  improves item rarity on failed pulls.
- `POST /gacha/auto-craft` toggles automatic crafting of upgrade items within an
  element. It accepts `{ "enabled": true | false }` and returns the updated
  flag.

## Testing
- `uv run pytest tests/test_gacha.py`
